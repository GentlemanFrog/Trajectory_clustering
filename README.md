# Trajectory_clustering
Script for analyzing data from software that tracks the movements of chloroplasts in plant cells.

The script performs a step-by-step analysis of data describing the trajectories of chloroplast movement.
The data was obtained using the TrackMate plugin for Fiji opensource software.
In my analysis, I focus on finding relationships in the data, which would allow for a more in-depth study of the movement of chloroplasts induced by blue light.
