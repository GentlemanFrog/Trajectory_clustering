# Trajectory_clustering
Script for analyzing data from software that tracks the movements of chloroplasts in plant cells.

The script performs a step-by-step analysis of data describing the trajectories of chloroplast movement.
The data was obtained using the TrackMate plugin for Fiji open-source software.
In my analysis, I focus on finding relationships in the data, which would allow for a more in-depth study of the movement of chloroplasts induced by blue light. There were 2 approaches to the script and its formula. The end version of the analysis is described in the Trajectory_analysis_2.0 and the results are stored in the subfolder with the prefix TA_ inside the data folders. Also, data folders contain the data and plots from previous iterations, as well as the data sets, used described as names with prefix spots_ or tracks_.
